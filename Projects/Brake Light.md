# Brake Light
## Purpose
Its just like the title says. Everyone wanting to work on PCB projects will be required to complete a brake light as an introduction to Altium.

Similar to the [[Onboarding#Software Onboarding|Software Onboarding Project]], the Brake Light project is designed to teach you key skills you need in order to be a contributing member of the team. If you are already familiar with PCB design, this project should be an easy refresher. For those new to PCB design, the Electrical Leads will be hosting tutorials on everything you need to know to get started. If you can't make the tutorials, some from outside the team have been linked below. Note that they are not FSAE specific.

While completing this project, make sure to follow all FSAE rules relevant to the project. How you design the control logic is completely up to you. However, the PCB must be able to run off of battery voltage (assume 10-14V). The Vbatt power rail is switchable on and off via the [[VCU]], but you also have a 3v3 signal rail available to you should you choose to use it.

## Rules
- [[T.3 Braking System]]
- [[EV.5.4 Grounded Low Voltage System]]
