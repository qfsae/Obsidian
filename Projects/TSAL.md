# Tractive System Active Light (TSAL)
## Purpose
The purpose of the TSAL is to alert surrounding persons that the car's tractive system is active. More specifically, that there is high voltage present at the Accumulator terminals.

The TSAL will consist of two components. First is the control PCB. This PCB will be connected to the HV and GLV systems. It will control the second component of the TSAL which is the TSAL light itself. The TSAL will be mounted in the roll hoop according to FSAE regulations. The LED could be an internal PCB project or a purchased component.
