# Discharge Circuit
## Purpose
The purpose of the discharge circuit is to fulfil the rules requirement [[EV.6.6 Precharge and Discharge#EV.6.6.3 Discharge Circuit|EV.6.6.3]]. A summary of the rule is as follows: The discharge circuit must discharge all voltage outside the Accumulator container to below 60VDC (as defined within [[T.9 Electrical Equipment#T.9.1 Definitions|Low Voltage]]) within under 5 seconds ([[EV.8.1 Shutdown Circuit#EV.8.2.2|EV.8.2.2]]).
The discharge circuit must be included because the discharge circuit within the CM200DX is not rules compliant. See [[Inverter Discharge Process (V0_9).pdf|Inverter Discharge Process]].
