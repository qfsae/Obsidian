Gigavac and Kilovac (TE) are the two primary manufacturers of relays used in Formula Student as Isolation relays.
Via FSAE Rules the AIRs must be
- normally open
- rated to the maximum TS voltage (~500VDC)
- have an interrupt rating greater than the short circuit current
- have a continuous current rating greater than the continuous current of the system (~ 240A)

## KILOVAC EV200
Contact rating for 900VDC/500A. Coil voltage 9-36VDC, 3.8A Inrush @ 9VDC.
2000A Max Break Current.
