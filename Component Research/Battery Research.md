# Battery Research
In order to compare all batteries equally, several assumptions were made. After the assumptions were applied, each battery cell was compared on weight, cost, energy capacity and number of cells needed.
The assumptions are listed below
- Maximum voltage of 460VDC
- Minimum discharge current of 180A
- Minimum capacity of 7.5kWh
