## Meeting Recap

I got a few messages about people not being able to come to yesterdays meeting so I thought I'd share a quick recap here.

1. The team has gotten access to ePower! We now have a high voltage workspace. Most of you won't have access but that's OK because most of our work will continue to be done in MCL.
2. Component Updates: We are still waiting on the mechanical department to order our components.
3. Onboarding: Onboarding is now completed. If you still haven't finished it its OK, just send either Alex or I a message about what you've done so far. The point of onboarding was just to get everyone familiar with the tools this team uses. If you've learnt something, you've completed onboarding.
4. Projects: If you still don't have a project, please go through the master projects list on obsidian and find something interesting. Once you've done that, send a teams message to the person listed as the project manager.

Yesterday we also did a brief high level overview of the cars electrical system. The PDF is [[EV Block Diagram.drawio.pdf]], but please note that it is an old copy and needs to have some changes made.
