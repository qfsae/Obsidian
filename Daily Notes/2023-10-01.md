Cost of initial order ~ $50.6-12.6 = 38.46

### 1v2 Motor Drive
Given the complexities of 1st year EV, combined with the current financial situation, the decision was made to return to a singular motor drive. We will still be purchasing the Emrax 188HV motors from UW. The current plan is to run a single motor drive this year and move to a two year design cycle for integration of the 2nd motor.
In order to support this, we will be ordering one CM200DX inverter from Cascadia, one set of HV connectors, but two GLVIC (Grounded Low Voltage Inverter Connection) wiring harnesses. This should mean that our financial situation improves later on in the year, or when it improves next year, all of the GLV wiring will already be in place. It is estimated that the installation of the GLVIC harness will be the most time consuming electrical task associated with installing the 2nd Inverter.
