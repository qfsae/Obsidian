## [[VCU]] Firm Note
Current config for timer peripheral seems to work well. Was able to produce 500hz, 1 and 10khz signals without error to a significant accuracy ($0.0 *10^{-3}$). System clock appears to have the correct configuration but is slightly off ($2*10^{-3}$hz). This causes some desync errors. Recommended future plan is to not use system clock for important timing aspects.
