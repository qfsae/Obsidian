Started creating this repo within my own private git

## HV Status
- main components approved by MP
- currently searching for suppliers
- need to create full bom
- need supplemental parts sheets

## Project Status
### ECU
- V_1 Currently in progress by Alex
- Design reviewed today before final adjustments
	- requires capacitors to be added to analog inputs
		- this is needed according to the STM32 datasheet - STM32 ADCs can have a maximum input impedance of 50k Ohms, after this the ADC struggles to obtain a valid reading, even over a long sample time.
		- Use of capacitors allows 0 input impedance at STM32 pin -> short read times now possible
	- Still need to swap UART 4/5 over to USART pins
		- allows for greater signal stability
	- Accel still not showing up in altium
	- Add indication LEDs
		- 2 red on micro (status)
		- blue leds for power (vin, 5, 3.3)
		- 2 other on micro (debug)
	- Layout + Silk screen still needs to be done
- Good from last time
	- added screw terminals for power in
	- changed to 100 pin package
	- exposed more SPI/UART (needs to be changed to usart)
	- ST Link header included and pin matched
	- Board power
		- changed to regulated supply (3A buck from MockECU)
		- LDO for 3v3 internal
		- USB5V separated from board power (? not sure - will need bench testing)
- Software review (TBD)
	- IMU drivers
	- Shift register drivers
	- Board Map -> needs to be done once finalized
	- Interrupt reg check
	- CAN ENABLE!
