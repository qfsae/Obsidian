## ECU Design review
- ADDED
	- 2 green indication lights for debugging
	- Exposed USART2/UART4 in addition to UART5(with rtx,cts)
- Micro USART2 -> CONN highlighted red
- Micro USART1->debugUART highlighted red
- debugger has many things highlighted red -> `debuggers connected.schdoc`
- All CAN bus currently shorted together (MCU->CAN_CONN)
- double check UART 5
	- datasheet labels PE7 as RX, PE8 as TX
- Board Power
	- Please use 1 resistor instead of 5 in series
	- DS3 and DS7 are useless without diodes between the headers and the rest of the 12V rail
	- Ethans buck does not prevent rail back powering. Need to add diode between inputs and outputs of different voltage rails
- Other Power
	- The led on the Vout side of the load switches are good.
	- we already have an led on the 12V rail. no need to clutter board
	- again, please just use one resistor instead of 5
	- 5V load switches
		- increase current limit to 0.5A -> I have a feeling our apps sensors draw about 200mA
		- Please add same indicator lights for 5v as 12v load switches
		- I am not opposed to putting them on the signal line either
	- 12V load switches
		- leave EPAD floating -> I read somewhere that it is for heatsink and will be connected to gnd internally if needed. This chip has a large Vin pad in the center and I don't want to risk a short -> we will double check in layout 
- Software
	- Review Accel/Gyro for drivers
	- future revision -> attach wheel speeds to timers for pulse width measurement
