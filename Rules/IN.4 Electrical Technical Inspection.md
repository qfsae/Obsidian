(EV Only)
## IN.4.1 Inspection Items
The following must be brought to Electrical Technical Inspection
- Charger for the Accumulator [[EV.9 Charging]]
- Accumulator Container Hand Cart [[EV.5.10 Accumulator Hand Cart]]
- Spare Accumulator(s) (if applicable)
- Electrical Systems Form (ESF) and Component Data Sheets [[EV.2 Required Documentation]]
- Copies of any submitted rules questions with the received answer
The following basic tools must also be brought in good condition
- Insulated cable shears
- Insulated screw drivers
- Multimeter with protected probe tips
- Insulated tools, if screwed connections are used in the Tractive System
- Face Shield
- HV insulating gloves which are less than the test date
- Two HV insulating blankets of minimum $0.83m^2$ each
- Safety glasses with side shields for all team members that might work on the Tractive System or Accumulator

## IN.4.2 Accumulator Inspection
The Accumulator(s) and associated equipment (Hand Cart, Chargers, etc) may be inspected during Electrical Technical Inspection, or separately from the rest of Electrical Technical Inspection.

## In.4.3 Accumulator Access
#### IN.4.3.1
If the Accumulator Container(s) is not easily accessible during Electrical Tech Inspection, detailed pictures of the internals taken during assembly must be provided.
#### IN.4.3.2
Tech inspectors may require access to check any Accumulators for rules compliance.

## IN.4.4 IMD Test
#### IN.4.4.1
The Insulation Monitoring Device will be tested by connecting a resistor between the Tractive System Measuring Points [[EV.6.8 TSMP]], and several electrically conductive vehicle parts while the Tractive System is active.
#### IN.4.4.2
The test is passed if the IMD shuts down the Tractive System in 30 seconds or less at a fault resistance of 50% below the response value corresponding to 250 Ohm / Volt.

## IN.4.5 Insulation Measurement Test
#### IN.4.5.1
The insulation resistance between the Tractive System and GLV System Ground will be measured. 
#### IN.4.5.2
The available measurement voltages are 250 V and 500 V. All vehicles with a maximum nominal operation voltage below 500 V will be measured with the next available voltage level. All teams with a system voltage of 500 V or more will be measured with 500 V.
#### IN.4.5.3
To pass the Insulation Measurement Test the measured insulation resistance must be minimum 500 Ohm/Volt related to the maximum nominal Tractive System operation voltage.

## EV.4.6 RTD Sound Test
The sound level will be measured with a free field microphone placed free from obstructions in a radius of 2 m around the vehicle against the criteria in [[EV.10 Vehicle Operations#EV.10.5 RTD Sound|EV.10.5]]

## IN.4.7 Electrical Inspection Completion
#### IN.4.7.1
All or portions of the Tractive System, Charger and other components may be sealed (IN.2.6)
#### IN.4.7.2
Additional monitoring to verify conformance to rules may be installed. Refer to the Event Website for further information.
#### IN.4.7.3
Electric Vehicles must pass Electrical Technical Inspection and Mechanical Technical Inspection before the vehicle may attempt any further Inspections. See [[EV.10 Vehicle Operations#EV.10.1.2]]
