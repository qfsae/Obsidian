#### EV.8.5.1
The AMS must measure the temperatures of critical points of the Accumulator

#### EV.8.5.2
Temperatures (considering measurement accuracy) must remain below the lower of the two:
- The maximum cell temperature limit stated on the datasheet
- 60 C

#### EV.8.5.3
Cell temperatures must be measured at the negative terminal of the respective cell

#### EV.8.5.4
The temperature sensor used must be in direct contact with either:
- The negative terminal itself,
- The negative terminal bus bar less than 10 mm away from the cell terminal

#### EV.8.5.5 Lithium Cells
For lithium based cells,
- The temperature of a minimum of 20% of the cells must be monitored by the AMS
- The monitored cells must be equally distributed within the Accumulator Container
- *Every cell temperature should be monitored*

#### EV.8.5.6
Multiple cells may be monitored with one temperature sensor if [[EV.8.5 Accumulator Temperature]] is met for all cells monitored by the sensor

#### EV.8.5.7 Isolation
Temperature sensors must have appropriate electrical isolation that meets one of the two:
- Between the sensor and cell
- In the Sensing Circuit
The isolation must consider both GLV/TS isolation as well as common mode voltages between sense locations
