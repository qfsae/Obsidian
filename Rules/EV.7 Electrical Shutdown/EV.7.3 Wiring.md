EV.7.3.1 All wires, terminals and other conductors used in the Tractive system must be sized for the continuous current they will conduct

#### EV.7.3.2 Tractive System Marking
All Tractive System Wiring must:
- Be marked with wire gauge, temperature rating and insulation voltage rating
	- A serial number or a norm printed on the wire is sufficient if this serial number or norm is clearly bound to the wire characteristics for example by a data sheet
- Have a minimum temperature rating of 90 C

#### EV.7.3.3 Sizing
Sizing of the conductors for the "Continuous Tractive System Current" may consider the:
- RMS or average electrical current that will be used
- Anticipated duration of time at a maximum electrical current

#### EV.7.3.4 Standards
All Tractive System Wiring must be:
- Done to professional standards with sufficient strain relief
- Protected against loosening due to vibration
- Protected against damage by rotating and/or moving parts
- Located out of the way of possible snagging or damage

#### EV.7.3.5 Wires Outside of Enclosures
Any Tractive System wiring that runs outside of electrical enclosures:
- must meet one of:
	- Enclosed in a separate orange nonconductive conduit
	- Use an orange shielded cable
- It also must either:
	- Run in a fully enclosed container.
		- Bodywork is not an enclosure
	- The conduit or shielded cable is securely anchored at each end to allow it to withstand a force of 200 N without straining the cable end crimp
- Any shielded cable must have the shield grounded

#### EV.7.3.6 Non TS Wiring
Wiring that is not part of the Tractive System must not use orange wiring or conduit
