#### EV.7.7.1
Parts of the vehicle which are 100 mm or less from any TS component must have a resistance less than:
- Electrically conductive parts = 300 mOhms
- Parts that may become electrically conductive = 5 Ohms

#### EV.7.7.2
Electrical conductivity of any part may be tested by checking any point which is likely to be conductive
Where no convenient point is available, an area of coating may be removed
