#### EV.7.4.1 TS Connections
All Tractive System Connections must:
- Be designed to use intentional current paths designed for electrical current
- Not rely on steel bolts to be the primary conductor
- Not include compressible materials such as plastic in the stack-up

#### EV.7.4.2 Heat Sinks
If external, uninsulated heat sinks are used, the must be properly grounded to the GLV System Ground. See [[EV.7.7 Grounding]]

#### EV.7.4.3 Bolt Connections
- Bolted connections in the high current path of the Tractive System must include a positive locking feature to prevent unintentional loosening
- Lock washers or thread locking compounds (Loctitie) or other adhesives are not acceptable
- Bolts with nylon patches are allowed for blind connections into OEM components

#### EV.7.4.4 Tech
Information about the electrical connections supporting the high current path must be available at [[IN.4 Electrical Technical Inspection]]
