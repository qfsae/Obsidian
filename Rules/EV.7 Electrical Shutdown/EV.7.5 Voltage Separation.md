#### EV.7.5.1 TS - GLV
Separation of the Tractive System and the Grounded Low Voltage System:
- The entire TS and GLV must be completely galvanically separated
- The border between the TS and the GLV is the galvanic isolation between both systems. Therefore, some components, such as the Inverter, may be part of both systems

#### EV.7.5.2
There must be no connection between the chassis of the vehicle (or any other conductive surface that may be touched by a person), and any part of the TS

#### EV.7.5.3
Tractive System and GLV circuits must not run through the same conduit or conductor, except as allowed in [[EV.8.8 Interlocks||EV.8.8.1]] 

#### EV.7.5.4
GLV systems other than the following must not be inside the Accumulator Container:
- [[EV.6.4 Accumulator Isolation Relays]]
- [[EV.6.6 Precharge and Discharge]]
- [[EV.8.3 AMS]]
- [[EV.8.6 IMD]]
- [[EV.6.9 TSAL]]
- [[EV.4 Electrical Limitations#EV.4.3 Energy Meter||Energy Meter EV.4.3]]
- Cooling fans

#### EV.7.5.5
When both the TS and GLV are included inside an enclosure, they must meet one of:
- Be separated by insulating barriers (in addition to insulation of the wire) made of moisture resistant, UL recognized or equivalent insulating materials rated for 150C or higher (such as Nomex based electrical insulation)
- Maintain the following spacing through air or over a surface
	- <100VDC 10mm
	- <200VDC 20mm
	- >200VDC 30mm

#### EV.7.5.6
Spacing must be clearly defined. Components and cables capable of movement must be positively restrained to maintain spacing

#### EV.7.5.7
If the TS and GLV are on the same circuit board:
- They must be on separate, clearly defined and marked areas of the board
- Required spacing related to the spacing between traces / board areas are as follows

| Voltage | Over Surface | Through Air | Under Conformal Coating |
| --------| -----------| ------------------| ---------------------|
|0-50 VDC| 1.6 mm | 1.6 mm | 1 mm|
| 50-150 VDC | 6.4 mm | 3.2 mm | 2 mm|
| 150-300 VDC | 9.5 mm | 6.4 mm | 3 mm |
| 300-600 VDC | 12.7 mm | 9.5 mm | 4 mm|

#### EV.7.5.8
Teams must be prepared to demonstrate spacing on team built equipment
For inaccessible circuitry, spare boards must be available for inspection

#### EV.7.5.9
All connections to external devices such as laptops from a TS components must also include galvanic isolation
