#### EV.10.3.5
Additional site specific rules or policies may apply

## EV.10.4 Activation Sequence
The vehicle systems must energize in the following sequence:
#### EV.10.4.1 [[EV.5.4 Grounded Low Voltage System]]
- The [[EV.8.1 Shutdown Circuit]] may be closed when or after the GLV system is energized

#### EV.10.4.2 TS Active
Definition: HV is present outside the Accumulator container
Tractive System Active must not be possible until both:
- GLV System is energized
- Shutdown Circuit is Closed

#### EV.10.4.3 Ready to Drive
Definition: The Motors will respond to APPS input
RTD (Ready to Drive) must not be possible until:
- TS Active
- The brake pedal is pressed and held to initiate RTD
- The Driver performs a manual action to initiate RTD
	- Can be activated with button in cockpit

## EV.10.5 RTD Sound
#### EV.10.5.1
The vehicle must make a sound when it is RTD (Ready to Drive)
#### EV.10.5.2
The RTD Sound must be:
- Sounded continuously for between 1 and 3 seconds
- A minimum of 80 dBA, fast weighting
	- (IN.4.6) RTD Sound - will be measured with a free field microphone placed free from obstructions in a radius of 2m around the vehicle against the criteria mentioned within EV.10.5
- Easily recognizable. No animal voices, song parts or sounds that could be interpreted as offensive will be accepted

#### EV.10.5.3
The vehicle must not make sounds similar to the RTD Sound
