#### EV.6.2.1 Voltage Ratings
All TS Components must be rated for the maximum TS Voltage [[T.9 Electrical Equipment#T.9.1 Definitions|High Voltage]]

#### EV.6.2.2 Container Isolation
If the Accumulator Container is made from an electrically conductive material:
- The poles of the Accumulator Segments and cells must be isolated from the inner wall of the Accumulator Container with an insulating material that is rated for the maximum TS Voltage
- All conductive surfaces on the outside of the Accumulator Container must have a low resistance connection to the GLV System Ground, See [[EV.7.7 Grounding]]
- Any conductive penetrations, such as the mounting hardware, must be protected against puncturing the insulating barrier.

#### EV.6.2.3 Segment Insulation
Each Accumulator Segment must be electrically insulated with suitable Nonflammable material (F.1.18) (not air) between the segments in the container and on top of the segments
- The intent is to prevent arc flashes caused by inter segment contact by parts or tools accidentally falling into the container during maintenance for example

#### EV.6.2.4 Soldering
Soldering electrical connections within the High Current path is prohibited.
- Soldering wires to cells for voltage monitoring is allowed as these wires are not part of the high current path

#### EV.6.2.5 Wire Insulation
Every wire used within the Accumulator (GLV and TS) must be rated to the maximum TS Voltage
