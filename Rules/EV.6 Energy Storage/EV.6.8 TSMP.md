#### EV.6.8.1 Installation
Two Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP) must be installed in the vehicle which are:
- Connected to the positive and negative Motor Controller/Inverter Supply lines
- Next to the [[EV.8.9 Master Switches]]
- Protected by a Nonconductive housing that can be opened without tools
- Protected from being touched with bare hands/fingers once the housing is opened

#### EV.6.8.2 Charger TSMP
Two TSPMs must be installed in the [[EV.9.2 Charger Features]] which are:
- Connected to the positive and negative charger output lines
- Available during charging of any Accumulator

#### EV.6.8.3 Requirements
The TSMPs must be:
- 4mm Shrouded Banana jacks rated to an appropriate voltage level
- Color: red
- Marked with "HV+" and "HV-"

#### EV.6.8.4 Current Limiting Resistor
- The resistor must be sized per the following:
	- TS Max Voltage <= 200 VDC = 5kOhm
	- TS Max Voltage <= 400 VDC = 10kOhm
	- TS Max Voltage <= 600 VDC = 15kOhm
- Resistor continuous power rating must be greater than the power dissipated across the TSMPs if they are shorted together
- Direct measurement of the value of the resistor must be possible during the [[IN.4 Electrical Technical Inspection]] 

EV.6.8.5 Any TSMP must not contain any additional Overcurrent Protection
